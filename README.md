Don't worry, this site lets the user rest easy knowing their escape to Disney parks from 
wherever they are at.
It is a simple website that pulls the user's location from the html5 api and gives them 
directions to DisneyLand then to DisneyWorld via google's map api. Content is refreshed 
on the page without the page being refreshed.
